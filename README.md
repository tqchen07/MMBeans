# MMBeans (Multi-diMensional Bay*e*sian nonp*a*rametric *n*etwork *s*ubtyping)


# Description
We developed MMBeans by integrating multi-state stochastic block models (SBMs) into Bayesian nonparametric clustering. This approach allows state-specific modular structures to be informed during the subtyping process using informative connectivity features that define identified subtypes. We created a variational inference (VI) algorithm and R scripts to implement this model. The details of the model and its implementation can be found in our paper, "Bayesian subtyping for multi-state brain functional connectome with application to preadolescent brain cognition."

# Usage
The MMBeans_function.R script contains the VI algorithm for the MMBeans model, while simulation_example.R demonstrates how to implement MMBeans.
